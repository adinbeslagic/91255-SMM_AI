## Exchange semester Bologna - Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Artificial Intelligence \\
Four Assignments with focus on different aspects Machine Learning \\
### Assignment 1 - Machine \epsilon & Matrix condition number \\
### Assignment 2 - SVD computation of Image (dyad, k-rank appr. and compression factor) & Classification of digit images using SVD and PCA \\
### Assignment 3 - Variations of Gradient descent (Vanilla, w/ backtracking and Stochastic) - training on a smaller data set and testing on a seperate larger set \\
